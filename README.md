# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_using_Tensorflow

We use the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset to predict the class to which, image of a handwritten digit belongs to. For the classifier we use a [Convoltutional Neural Network](https://adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) which is constructed with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework.

## About Dataset

The **MNIST** Dataset has **65000** images of **handwritten digits** divided into **10** classes(Digits: **0-9**), each class having **6500** images. The Dataset is further divided into a **training set(55000 images)** and **test set(10000 images)**. Each image is of dimension **28x28**. 

## Model performance

We were able to achieve test set accuracy of **99.06%**.
